# ArduTanks
This project was created by Max Busch as an assignment for the CGL BA4 Hardware Programming Class.
It consists of a Unity game (ArduTanks) as well as a custom built arcade machine including a control-panel powered by an Arduino Uno R4 Wifi that is required for the input. **Control methods other than these are not supported**

# Wiring Diagram
This diagram shows the wiring required for the project to work.
Note that to improve readability of the diagram only one pair of parts is connected. For the game to work a second pair needs to be connected, using pins that were purposely left free.
