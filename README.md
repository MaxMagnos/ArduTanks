# ArduTanks
This project was created by Max Busch as an assignment for the CGL BA4 Hardware Programming Class.
It consists of a Unity game (ArduTanks) as well as a custom built arcade machine including a control-panel powered by an Arduino Uno R4 Wifi that is required for the input. **Control methods other than these are not supported**
